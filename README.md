# Nclude-Android-App

E-commerce Android Application

## Description

This app is a general template for an e-commerce platform intergrated with Firebase Database, Realm Database, 
and Strip Payments.

## How It Works

There are 4 item categories that can be chosen from in the side navigation drawer as well as a "Contact Us" section.
As items are chosen, they are carried through the Realm database to the item cart. Items can also be removed individually
from the item cart. If the cart items seem appropriate the price is carried over to the payment screen which excepts credit
card payments through the use of Strip. The app is truely customizable to fit the selling needs of an individual. All keys 
must be obtained by having accounts thoguh Firebase and Strip.
